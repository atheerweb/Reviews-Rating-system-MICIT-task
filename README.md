### Project Architecture

#### What is Feature-Based Architecture?

Feature-based architecture is a design strategy that organizes code around business features rather than technical concerns. A feature represents a coherent set of functionalities that delivers specific value to the end-user. In Vue, this means grouping all the files related to a specific feature — such as components, state management, and API calls — into a single directory.
